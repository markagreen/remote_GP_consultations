# Trends in remote GP consultations for England

Aims: To explore trends in General Practice (GP) consultations for English CCGs pre- and post-pandemic, identify the extent of primary health care disruption, and assess the extent that this has resulted in negative health and inequalities outcomes.

The repo is structured as follows:

* gp_remote_consultations.rmd / gp_remote_consultations.html - a report assessing trends in GP consultations focusing on remote consultations (e.g., telephone or online). The html file is a processed R notebook, which include all R code, outputs and description of results. The rmd file allows anyone to recreate the html file
* missing_data.rmd / missing_data.html - a report analysis the quality of the NHS Digital data used in the above report. The html file is the processed notebook, whereas the rmd is the R file for recreating the html report.
* Data - all data used in the reports allowing replication of analyses
